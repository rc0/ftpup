- When building inventory, put subdirectories before files, so that upload is
  done depth first.  (This will help with getting .listing files updated after
  the files they list.)

- Treat mtime zero as a wildcard when doing the initial matching.

- Don't try to upload .swp.

- Add is_stale stuff.
- Upload changed files

- md5 stuff, rename detection + upload

- write out clean journal before starting upload process

- test against more ftp servers

- active data connection

- show %done for file upload to give more comfort for slow servers.

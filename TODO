- when building remote inventory, detect lack of write perm and fix. (? do we need this?)

- truncate paths to just the right-most portion for comfort messages

- comfort messages need to include how many files are done v how many to go and
  an idea of total amount of date done and to go also.

- remember hostname, username and remote root details in listing file.  Should
  only have to enter them when doing the -R option the first time.

- write out clean journal before starting upload process

- show %done for file upload to give more comfort for slow servers + start/finish messages

- md5 stuff, rename detection + upload

- test against more ftp servers

- active data connection

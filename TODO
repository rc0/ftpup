- when building remote inventory, detect lack of write perm and fix. (? do we need this?)

- truncate paths to just the right-most portion for comfort messages

- comfort messages need to include how many files are done v how many to go and
  an idea of total amount of date done and to go also.

- for update, write new file to a temporary name and use renaming after the
  upload - avoid situation where a half-present file is on the remote site for
  an extended period.  (use STOU)

- show %done for file upload to give more comfort for slow servers + start/finish messages

- valgrind the program

- rename + retag to usable name for release

- md5 stuff, rename detection + upload (chains + rings of renames etc)

- when mtime is zero from fileinv, update with mtime from corresponding localinv

- globally configurable ignore lists (with globbing)

- per-directory and per-subtree ignore lists

- test against more ftp servers

- active data connection
